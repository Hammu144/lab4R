```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(Linreg)
```
Here i have initialize the object for the class.

```{r }

l1 <-  linreg$new(Petal.Length~Species, data = iris)
```

In this method we return the vector of e^.

```{r }
l1$resid()
```

In this method we return the predicted value of Y.

```{r }
l1$pred()
```
In this method we return the coefficient as a named Vector.


```{r }
l1$coef()
```

In this method we return output with a print method and that output is same as the output of lm() method.

```{r }
l1$summary()
```
In this method we print the Linreg object with our own defined print method.

```{r }
l1$print()
```
In the Plot() method we print two different Plots with the Linreg class Object.

```{r }
l1$plot()
```
